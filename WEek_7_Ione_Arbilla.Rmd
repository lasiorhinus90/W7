## Importing dataset

Reading csv file in  a Dataset obtained from Jobs dataset in https://data.worldbank.org/ and not importing lines located at the end of the document with the filter function.


```{r setup,include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
Dataset<-read.csv("Jobs_Database_Dataset.csv")%>%
  filter(row_number() <= n()-5)
```
## Diagnose of the dataset

This dataset  is wide formatted data, so we will need some pivoting. I created a variable called year to address the problem. I also decided to use parse_number to get rid of the leters and extra numbers that made difficult to read the years. Then I mutated the value column to identify the NA values as NA insetad of ".." and converted it to numeric, since the column is indeed numeric. Finally I altered the column names, round the decimals of the value columns and made a selection of the dataset that i believe could be adequate to compare the indices of two different countries:

```{r cars,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(rlang)
library(readr)


Dataset%>%
  pivot_longer(`X2011..YR2011.`:`X2016..YR2016.`,names_to = "year")%>%
  mutate(year=parse_number(year))%>%
  mutate(value=na_if(value,".."))%>%
  mutate(value=as.numeric(value))%>%
  select(Ã¯..Country.Name, Series.Name,year,value)%>%
  set_names(c("Country","Indices","Year","Value"))%>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 1))%>%
  filter((Country=="Afghanistan"& Year == 2011)|(Country=="Burundi"& Year == 2011))%>% 
  write.csv("Table.csv")

```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
Table<-read.csv("Table.csv")
Table

```

### Including Plots
 Here I added the plots that compare the indices of the selected countries in the year 2011 except of one index which was in a different unit.
